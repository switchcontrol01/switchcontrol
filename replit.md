# SwitchControl

## Overview

SwitchControl is a web-based gaming optimization dashboard prototype. It offers a UI-first experience for simulated Windows system tweaks, power plan management, network optimization, and system monitoring. The application uses a dark theme with purple/pink accents, aiming for a clean gamer aesthetic. All optimization actions within this prototype are simulated and do not make actual Windows system changes. The project vision is to provide a modern, polished tool for system enhancement, with potential for market expansion within the gaming community.

## System Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, Tailwind CSS for styling (v4, dark theme), shadcn/ui for components, Zustand for client-side state, TanStack Query for server state, Framer Motion for animations, and Vite for building.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for schema and interactions.
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) for user authentication.

### Data Models
Key data models include `userSettings` (preferences, tier), `appliedTweaks` (enabled tweaks), `historyEntries` (action log), `aiScans` (AI advisor results), and `users/sessions` (Replit Auth data).

### Application Structure
The application is structured into `client/src` (frontend components, hooks, utilities, pages), `server/` (Express entry, routes, database), and `shared/` (Drizzle schema, auth models).

### UI/UX Design
- **WebsiteShell**: Provides a consistent layout with three variants (full, inner, minimal), featuring an animated background with glow blobs, SVG grid, fractal noise, and a mouse-follow spotlight. It includes a sticky, blur-effect header and a shared footer.
- **GlassPanel**: A versatile glass-effect component with different material variants (default, elevated, matte) and optional glow accents or hover effects.
- **GlowButton**: Primary call-to-action button with a glow rim and micro-animations.
- **Modals**: A shared `GlassModalLayout` component provides a consistent visual style (dark translucent background, blurred border) and behavior (escape handling, backdrop close, scroll lock) for various interactive modals (e.g., Memory Cleaner, CPU Cores).
- **Window Controls**: Custom-styled window control buttons with glass-blended appearance for Electron desktop builds.
- **Global Text Selection**: `user-select: none` is applied globally for a premium feel, with exceptions for input fields and copyable text.

### Key Features
- **Dashboard**: Displays system stats, simulates RAM clearing, initiates AI advisor scans, and shows live telemetry graphs (CPU, RAM).
- **Tweaks**: Offers categorized, searchable system optimization toggles with informational modals.
- **Network Tweaks**: Provides simulated optimizations for SMB, TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, and security settings.
- **Power Plan**: Allows selection and customization of power profiles.
- **History**: Logs simulated actions with JSON export.
- **Settings**: Manages account preferences and app configuration.

### AI Advisor System
A fully local, deterministic rule engine evaluates system and application signals against a bundled ruleset (`bundled.ruleset.json`). It provides recommendations (critical, recommended, informational) and can trigger app-tweak fixes. The advisor is read-only and does not modify core application state.

### Electron Desktop App
The Electron app provides a unified `window.electronAPI` interface via `preload.js` for interacting with native system features. It uses the `systeminformation` package for real hardware data (CPU, GPU, RAM), offers native tweak execution (via `tweak-executor.js`), and includes a native Rust-based RAM cleaner.

### Native RAM Cleaner
A Rust helper binary (`sc_memory.exe`) performs simulated RAM trimming using safe Win32 APIs (EmptyWorkingSet). It offers multiple modes (safe, smart, advanced) and outputs JSON results, integrated via IPC from Electron.

### AppFlow State Machine
Manages exclusive application flows (`firstTime`, `premiumUnlock`, `premiumTour`) with a defined priority order. It handles state hydration, entitlement checks, and prevents re-triggering unlock animations within a session.

### Unified Tour System
Both onboarding and premium guided tours utilize a shared `TourShell` component, featuring custom smooth scrolling, animated spotlights, and consistent styling. Tours conclude with a Discord CTA and prevent replay via server-side flags.
